## Hej 👋

My name is Edd and I am a Software Engineer in Stockholm. Previously lived in Palo Alto, Oxford, and London. 

I am interested in how we can build software quickly and correctly in the age of LLMs and AI. 

Always interested in chatting about tech, startups, or my hobbies: BJJ, chess, and gaming / boardgames.

Currently studying for an MEng in Engineering Management at CU Boulder part-time.
