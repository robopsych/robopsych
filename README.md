## Hej 👋

My name is Edd and I am a Software Test Engineer in Stockholm. Previously lived in Palo Alto, Oxford, and London. 

I am interested in how we can build software quickly and correctly in the age of LLMs and AI. 

Always interested in chatting about tech, startups, or my hobbies: BJJ, chess, and gaming / boardgames.
